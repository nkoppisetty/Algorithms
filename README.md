# Kruskalâ€™s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm

A spanning tree of a connected and undirected graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) or minimum weight(here distance) spanning tree for a weighted, connected and undirected graph is a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.

Implemented an algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree of the given undirected graph(graph.csv) which is in the form of adjacency lists.

## Output:
- Edges and their distances in the Minimum Spanning Tree
- Total no. of edges in the Minimum Spanning Tree
- Sum of all the distances in the Minimum Spanning Tree
